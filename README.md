# Mozart's Musical Dice

The Musikalisches WÃ¼rfelspiel is one of the first examples of interactive music, which was composed by Mozart. Depending on multiple dice rolls, a different piece of music is played. This is done by combining measures to generate a minuet and a trio, both which are 16 measures, to create a waltz. 

I read about this while taking MUSPREF 300: Video Game Music at the University of Michigan, so I thought about creating a program to play the music. This Python program generates, plays, and saves the composition to a file called dice.wav.
